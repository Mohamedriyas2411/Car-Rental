    <!-- About Us Content -->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Car rental web application is a peer-to-peer car rental platform that connects car owners (Renters) with individuals seeking a rental (Rentees), offering an easy, secure, and cost-effective way to rent cars. Car owners can list their vehicles, set rates (under â‚¹20/km), and accept rental requests, while Rentees can browse available cars, send requests, and book once accepted, generating a Booking ID. The process includes car inspections before and after rentals, a security deposit for damage protection, and mechanic verification to ensure car condition. With transparent tracking and location assistance, once the car is returned, documents are verified, and a final bill is generated based on duration and distance with 5 to 10% of service charges will be added, ensuring a smooth, reliable rental experience for both parties.</p>

        <p> "Swift Drive Car Rentals" Founded in 2023,  was created to make car rentals more affordable and accessible for both car owners and renters. Our platform enables car owners to rent their vehicles and earn extra income, while offering renters a variety of vehicles to choose from, all at competitive prices.</p>
